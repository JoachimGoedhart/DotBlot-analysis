# DotBlot-analysis

Repository with Python code in a Jupyter Notebookto to perform automated (image) analysis on dotblot data.

## Introduction 
Levels of chemokines are measured through an array that produces a [dotblot as result](https://www.rndsystems.com/products/proteome-profiler-human-cytokine-array-kit_ary005b). Every dot is linked to different antibodies, and we must quantify it in order to get informative data on levels. Previously, dot blot quantification has typically been done manually.

Therefore, the aim of this Jupyter Notebook is to automate the processing and analysis of dotblots. The different steps are registering each single dotblot to the mask, to get the grey value from each dot, and finally to arrange the values in a [tidy table](https://thenode.biologists.com/converting-excellent-spreadsheets-tidy-data/education/) to allow for a reproducible (and possibly automated) analysis.

## Before Starting 

To run the program on Google Colab, ensure that the data is saved in your Google Drive. Alternatively, if you prefer to use as Jupyter Notebook, download the Notebook and ensure that the data is stored in a local directory.

For the code to work, Images must be 700 by 300 pixels (width x height) and in .tif format. This is best done in FIJI/ImageJ before starting the analysis. 

If you donâ€™t provide data, the notebook will still run and use example data.

If any of the steps fail, it is suggested to file [an issue](https://github.com/JoachimGoedhart/DotBlot-analysis/issues) on GitHub. 

## Initialization & Packages

The notebook requires several libraries and these will be remotely initialized in Google Colab. If you are running the notebook locally, you need to install the relevant packages in your environment.

## Data input and output 

The notebook loads all TIF files from a directory (specified as `in_dir`). When running it on Colab, make sure that the TIF files are on your Drive in a single folder. The resulting registered images and CSV files will be stored in another directory (`out_dir`)
